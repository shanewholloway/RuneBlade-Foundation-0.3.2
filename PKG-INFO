Description: RuneBlade Foundation Components
        
        XML Objectify Inspiration:
        David Mertz at Gnosis software just has a head for Python,
        and for thinking out of his dodecahedron, as he seems to
        be very many sided.  One of my favorites of his work takes
        XML and makes it read like Python.  I couldn't be more at
        home, unless I made it my own.  Oh wait, thats what this is
        about, isn't it?

        Skinning:
        wxPython is a great cross platform windowing toolkit.  This
        xml "resource" toolkit is similar to many others, only it is
        allowed to wiggle because it is python powered!
        
        Please see http://www.wxpython.org
        
        Jabber:
        Well, I never thought I'd meet a talking snake, much less teach
        one to chat.
