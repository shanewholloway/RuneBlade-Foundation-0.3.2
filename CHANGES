    <about>
        RuneBlade Foundation is a set of tools that have been created to ease the 
        development of XML-based applications written in Python.  Now, you say,
        there are a lot of XML based tools out there.  Well, these tools are not
        tools that help one move XML, but rather use XML and Python to breath 
        abundant life into applications.  For instance, using XML via Jabber for
        communications; XML "skin" for a wxPython GUI; or, an XML "skin" for xhtml 
        or svg output, like Albatross or other templating engines.

    <release title='RuneBlade Foundation' version='0.3.2' date='2002.09.19'>
        Celebration for wxPython 2.3.3, including other optimizations and bugfixes.

        <features title='Foundation'>
            Added a LazyProperty that calls ClassFactory to instantiate a variable on the first reference.
            Added a __hash__ method to WeakBind
            Optimized XMLObjectify's _toXML to run a bit faster
            Optimized some dervied SkinObjects to disregard PCData if they didn't use it
            Seperated ObjectifiedXML to derive from AttributedObjectifiedXML (mixin) and BaseObjectifiedXML
            BaseObjectifiedXML can have AttributedObjectifiedXML added at runtime as an Aspect
            Moved BaseObjectifiedXML's __getattribute__ into ObjectifiedXML for speed reasons
            Created 
        </features>

        <features title='Foundation.AOSubjectObserver'>
            Refactored &amp; reworked the SubjectObserver package with concepts from the AspectOriented package, and created a new approach with cleaner distinctions.  I'm not yet finished, but you're welcome (encouraged even!) to peek &amp; suggest!
            Added several Interfaces -- lean Subject, 'classic' Subject, Publisher
            Added several AccessRules -- ignore, simple, protective, and semaphore
            Added several LogicRule Collections -- List, Ordered List, Dictionary, and Set if you have Python 2.3 or it's set implementation
            Added one LogicRule Notification strategy -- Simple iteration!  

            Plans for more LogicRules: First-acknoledged, Composites, Categorical, Bidding, and other custom wx / jabber related.
        </features>

        <features title='Foundation.Skinning'>
            Added an activex skin element to allow for straight insertion into skin files.
            Added an invisible DOT skin element
            Changed the interface of SkinContext slightly in order to be more flexable
        </features>

        <features title='Foundation.wxTools'>
            Added a wxActiveXWrapper module to add some functionality to wxPython.lib.activexwrapper, and to support the activex skin element.
        </features>

        <bugfixes>
            Fixed a major bug in XMLBuilder/XMLObjectify with namespace prefix problems on _toXML
            Changed XMLObjectify's _toXML to include the namespace in the result, rather than assume it's correct
            Fixed wxTools.wxFrameMover and wxTools.wxLockingFrame synergies so things don't "vibrate"
            Optimized a lot of code using the Python 2.3 profiler and some instrumented tests.
            Fixed some naming and comparison problems in WeakBind
            Fixed some itereation issues in DOT Skinning
            Fixed an ordering issue in wxPythonSkin/layout.py to work with <xhtml:a href='http://wxpython.org/'>wxPython 2.3.3.1</xhtml:a>
            Fixed an assertion in wxPythonSkin/text.py to work with <xhtml:a href='http://wxpython.org/'>wxPython 2.3.3.1</xhtml:a>; wxTE_PROCESS_ENTER is not allowed in conjunction with multiline controls.
