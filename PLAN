    <about>
        RuneBlade Foundation is a set of tools that have been created to ease the 
        development of XML-based applications written in Python.  Now, you say,
        there are a lot of XML based tools out there.  Well, these tools are not
        tools that help one move XML, but rather use XML and Python to breath 
        abundant life into applications.  For instance, using XML via Jabber for
        communications; XML "skin" for a wxPython GUI; or, an XML "skin" for xhtml 
        or svg output, like Albatross or other templating engines.
