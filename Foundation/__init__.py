"""RuneBlade Foundation Components

XML Objectify Inspiration:
    David Mertz at Gnosis software just has a head for Python, 
    and for thinking out of his dodecahedron, as he seems to 
    be very many sided.  One of my favorites of his work takes
    XML and makes it read like Python.  I couldn't be more at 
    home, unless I made it my own.  Oh wait, thats what this is
    about, isn't it?
    
    Please see http://gnosis.cx

Skinning:
    wxPython is a great cross platform windowing toolkit.  This 
    xml "resource" toolkit is similar to many others, only it is 
    allowed to wiggle because it is python powered!
    
    Please see http://www.wxpython.org

Jabber:
    Well, I never thought I'd meet a talking snake, much less teach
    one to chat.
